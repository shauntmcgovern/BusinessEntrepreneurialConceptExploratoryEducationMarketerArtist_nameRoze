  Is that if you where to input(input/')/0' the NUMErical {SYS}tem into our digital focus, realm world place place to put numbers in thin air
  holding them their in data'sets. Each individual data set from each different company or the even the same company this digital data could be under the
  direct, past and future influence--exacting--economical changes that we are taking changes to the ARCHAIC Numeral system that has been with us since
  we can remember as a HumanRace. Do you see how these digital data archiving systems reflect the age old and true """NUMBER SYSTEM""/" and with
  these quotients with these constants with these numerical changes the digital system can have different kinds of numbers interacting with the mathematical
  system even programming Strings and what happens is significant room for error and faults. This goes hand in hand, with the inflation of 
  the United States of America. I found this out during a stay at a gas station that creamer and sugar and catzup is free, leaving me to my devices
  and living second hand off of others living from use to use using these government supplemental benefits and a community church dinner or two,
  the economy hasn't changed since the 60/'ms(oSF*9/""'-_w/') in this refelct and in this way of life. Which we all do live--be it rather
  poor, middle class or rich every income bracket has these government supplemental ablities and we should all use

• This one is driving interest, once again for those entrepreneurs that can learn to live to play. At which point in economical historiography, economical historiography+MSFT,
  does a company drive enough profits have enough profits and become so monetary stable that profits natural profits and incoming expected always expected profits become the norm,
  what I am saying as a Computer Scientist is when-a company, a corporation a private conglomerate dominate so in domination that it will never have money problems only 
  beneficial outlook. We are talking a name brand here, performing so well so expected that it REIN<s> the mar<ket>s. That its pratical economical failure is non-existent. And within this--++'
• --++''is a form of economic room for growth under competition selection. Through this competition these companies, conglomerates even corporations are'allowed{allowed}f+/ to thrive.
  There isn't any rule'set. People the economic customers economic users economic grossers' know what they want, what they like I come to find is to make their life easier with something
  that accomadates them exactly something just for them that is actually a, "Necessity"". Markets, POTFUS''/P'
• I would like to discuss the silver platter and different ways to take this. @Chase @POTUS45 @BHHSRealEstate. 
• When it comes to the economy it all represents the bottomline so doesn't that mean there is always an answer. 
• One way to look at capitalism is to drive profits and more profits, monetize anything that you can think of. 
• I was thinkin' with @KingJames the other day and not only is this profit coming off direct interaction but also profit
  can rain in from the indirect, representation of the fact that an entity is a legacy and unchangeable. 
• Further branchin' off, Wall Street @WSJ is all about profiting off ingenuity, ideas and what you bring to the table. 
  Howabout profiting off of, the term, "Girl Power." Wouldn't that be neat.
• That is why we "gauge the price, you check the price of each successful business entrepreneur in each of their own certain way." So
  this has to do with intellectual property, and a showcase of what the individual brings to the table and what fields of professionalism
  their net worth of each of their "net intellectual property stretch and bi-cursors and their cultural phenoms that bring "additives" to
  each and every market, that is available. Like stock incentives...Fortune 500 more like Formula Fortune 500. indebtitude.
• I can only think of terms, indirectlly or refering to there lasting power, as any company tries to build a legacy and some will succesfully
  be around for a very long time, lasting past the lifetimes of their CEO's. Now its similar to NFTs and how the image represents the overall
  idea, the economical representation. As you can take any name brand and apply it in a imaginative world, a figurative world, a dream world
  where it takes on different purposes. Further meaning blending well-known names with well-known companies that are good to the public.
  The meaning of the long-lasting appeal of a company's image and what it stands for the public taking on a more interactive display.
• One more thing while I have you anything that doesn't sell anything is gold(Au). 
• Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell. 
• I have one more. This is written in the company mission statement. If I am any kind of employee from the store to the office board 
  member what can happen is this. I take in and embody the company to my best ability and I am low on the totem pole but at times 
  I can be the CEO and get things done. 
• What this business entrepreneurial concept is meant to do is venture out to any field or professionalism that we can 
  possibly think of and inquire how our systems our representing us and if they are in fact doing their job for us all. 
  Education and law enforcement need this. 
• @GMC. 
• I want you to begin to think of a world where anything can in fact be sold and if it can be, it is considered a possession. 
  Let us achieve a collective vindication. Its all of our goods, everythings a goodie. Its the economy, black market, the real 
  actual market you see before you and anything that you can think of, desire or may think of when it comes time.
• No competition is needed between companies for the fight of profits only the beneficial income of the parlay is of necessity, commodity.
• When it comes down to the same. If a company where to organize itself, offer its public offerings, commodites and services exactly so   
  and just like other companies that are in the same position this new company would like to commandeer then what happens is this.
  You lay down the architecture of this company the same way the others are ordered and laid out. Then these companies rely on the 
  purchaser, buyer and guest choices. Further meaning it will result in a personal specificity which is the choice of the
  happy-giving-money-holder.
• Then take, which of what thy has of all is which is yet to be ours, once again all. Then is thy that have'it for it was once
  attached to others. eth. banks.
• So there would be worth of made of money of the certain times and during the understood time of a brand name and a trademark.
• Now is this where inflation begins and ends and do I have something here and would it begin to turn into our favor if this
  where to be held as true do you need me to explain this for you and since when does everything cost an arm and leg when it
  used to only cost an arm. Those belongings and operations leading to the completion of what is to be acquire even lived with
  and used over and over again. It would seem that other things are driving down that price and why is that is that because
  you want to understand the difference of the assets compared to the liabilities and what is the difference anymore so their equity. >>.
• Where to begin, in the social hierarchy meaning your personal monetary stability leading to then your own income bracket meaning how
  you and yourself which is your party, your own family. Are going to then live. Economic displacement. Economic stability, once more.
  Economic ownership of your own personal assets. Assets, Assets, and Assets. This is how you exactly judge your wealth and so on. Whose
  got money whose got a little? Money. The period the commas leading to significant ownership and can that specific asset with all its
  monetary even physical liablities can then churn, churn the dough I said. From every different economic bracket that you live in
  and make your very ownership you have this designation. Either poverty, poor, middle class, comfortable middle class,
  high-end middle class, and then the Rich{/?'meaning important to the society that you build your hard own wealth'on--usually the rich
  are the power figures becauseofit'}?/'then you have just Aquaberry Rich and perhaps can make "Boss Moves" Rich and then finally the super,
  super, super I mean stinky filthy filthy over God-Like Rich where some of our friends, the power players, can only enter the room with
  them see what they are doing STUPID Real REAL REALLY FUCKING SO RICH MONEY is no longer an object as it was before and all those categories
  I have named, those and us income brackets, it still in fact is. How many times do we all have to tighten our belts. This is where the rich
  people lose, they take care of us, this is where less things are available to others because of this reason and its alot of cluttering
  up the subjects, the bottom-lines at hand. Because at the end of the day its all about the bottom-line. If grown adults can't come to a
  decision of debt and costs. What does that exactly tell us. For decades fighting over what needs to be done, exactly. What is our outlook,
  together. Which brings me to the other point I would like to make. That from the lamb, you have poor middle class or rich and everybody
  is perfectly satisfied meaning we can all come to a personal decision that we, I and our decisions have lead us to this monetary income bracket.
  At the end of the day. Everyone can achieve the same reflect. Afford, the necessary utilties of how to live a good-life and continue on,
  persevere and move on to the next day. We constantly, as good Americans come to this reflect once more and the economic exchanges of that
  thats his coin, thats her coin and this is that families coin, is so prominant so brought-out so bright so vindictative so performing so "pre-chanced"
  so so, so such a good remark and economic reflect. That to each is own and may you die with the hard earned coin no matter the amount
  beit'large or small. I have found that after you spoil your women, famously, setup your family for generations even, there is only so many
  things you can buy even {/r'}ich. Rich'ric0'c:"':;?/h/?' so you can make those boss-boss/boss-bossboss"?/mboss?(:)':';"'?/?/Boss moves, and
  actually have fun with the U.S. Economy and lose money, gain money, take money, gain gain money, and loss/lost money, so money things,,
  monetary riches,, of the rich,, and well off[0?[?/"'0?F/"0?F"]"/]. Because that is how you have made yourself into whether you inheirited it
  from family or the other costs of hard work. From career work to manual labor, that M-F 7AM-6PM:::'
• --Fixed economic mechanisms--f☐(:):;S"'?/. What never changes. I speak of when a family could support themselves no matter the trade,
  skill or career. For life. A house and its materials used to cost this. Now its this. Has wood and concrete changed? Is the grass on a
  different planet, already??/r{.cot}"'?/ I didn't think so. So some of these necessary materials. The paint and bricks for the chiminies.
  The electric costs to build a light fixture and for all of the bedrooms, family room, den and kitchen do you have a porch? What type of
  ceiling would you like to live under? Which paint would you like to use, which store do we have to goto'? The production of wood,
  family stone, house-work I am saying the necessary materials to build a house then fill it with a families love?? Those necessary
  materials haven't changed in centuries. But the price, surely has. Now hasn't it. Do you need those necessary house-building
  mater?ials?/(:):;?/msM"'?/<,.>T' Well check the year of this modern-day and age and their you will find the price, you mean for the
  same thing that was bought before? No. What I meant was that if you reach a certain amount of economic stability, I'm talkin' real rich
  and connected everything is free, because you can make it yours, you need to be seen with it, you can live with it, or its just around,
  or like I said money is no longer an object, you have conquered it your rich. What is expensive to some means absolutely nothing in the
  grand econcomic scheme of things and it will never will because you have to move on and buy other things, that you have hard owned through
  your blood sweat and tears to gain. Often, its through alot of hard work and then some, more hardwork to be achieved then hopefully you can
  invest and make things happen. Because you can move money around and some are large lump sums into another, gain, then take the necessary
  costs away and try to make some money from several propositions leading to an economic benefit which is usually great for all. Because it
  opens up their options, economic equality is so profitable economic oppressionists chose that over those hard decisions because they
  are filled with necessary greed to power their billion dollar companies and acquisitions..."(P)0?/'P"Mmn<,.>{S}?/"'?'{T}"'?/<,.>M'M   >>. 
    •• --PThen what you have is a form of a fixed economic "tabor." A form of economic mechanism, that only rises that only grows?
       With no end, called inflation. And this is serious it makes every single income bracket, "tighten their belts"". Sure there is
       off-setting mechanisms at play, that the economy uses for this and inflation, but every company is different every business
       entrepreneur is different and especially with all of the money that they can only throw around at the time of economic effort,
       or afford to throw around that is,,--completely. So you have a driving economic force, that only increases. With nothing telling
       us where it comes from, who is doing it and mostly those who do come to blame, is the hard-working Americans that need their money
       for their expenses and their living styles. Lets face it. We have a form of inflation that will never come to an end. Its almost
       become another tax. Economic special terms, aside. Its the dotted lines, its the cost of what we can do as the American People.
       I'm tired of hearing about Unions going under, bankrupt. I am tired, so drear, so so tired of an outstanding business entrepreneur
       having to turn their entire business outlooks around, just because of this. So their needs to be solutions. Often when it comes to
       the dollar. Speaking of, how does the American dollar have its worth--, its price of the dollar, change? It changes because a penny,
       a nickel used to be worth more actually made of silver even, back before this current and present time in this U.S. Economy. 
       And remember, my expertise is not economics its computer science. So this is only a rough-draft. That being said. The yen is good
       in comparison. Actually the yen and the dollar go well together. How about the peso, next door? Or some of the Royal Family's money,
       hows that doin'? The object, itself and now these days. We use digital currency, I'm not saying ETH, I am speaking about our dollar and
       coin don't even leave the B[]'ank it just gets transacted and it moves from business to business. You die with your entire net worth
       albeit small or large or rather sum, go, in debt. Gone. So what exactly, can we list, as often the best economists do, our fixed economic
       mechanisms that the U.S. Economy must bear in order to operate, and with that what comes, is a much better scope, grasp, for any
       interested business entrepreneur and finish signing those dotted lines. -DIOP;(:):';?/
• I would like to address the community, as a whole, and now your thinking of select and rich business entrepreneurs that have taken the time to
  build what is rightfully theres. Do we have any form of intellectual property protection. Who is going and walking around and saying this is theirs
